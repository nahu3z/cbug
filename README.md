# cbug

This resource enables a list of in-game glitches. It currently includes the following:

*   **crouchbug:** This glitch allows players to cancel the post-shooting animation by using the crouch key.
*   **fastfire:** This glitch allows players to cancel the full firing animation, enabling faster firing with slow-firing weapons such as the Desert Eagle.
*   **fastmove:** This glitch allows players to move quickly with slow weapons (e.g. Deagle) by using specific key combinations while standing up after crouching.
*   **fastsprint:** This feature allows players to tap space with a macro, boosting their speed beyond normal GTA San Andreas limits.
*   **quickreload:** This glitch allos players to reloads the weapon by switching weapon slots, bypassing the standard reload animation.
*   **quickstand:** This glitch allows players to quickly stand up by pressing the crouch, sprint, or jump controls immediately after releasing the aim button while crouched.

## Features

This resource provides two main features based on these glitches:

*   **autoreload:** Automatically reloads the weapon after each shot by rapidly switching weapon slots (using the `quickreload` glitch). This also enables cbug for Shotgun and Sniper.
*   **autocbug:** Automatically cancels the post-shooting animation when the player stops aiming. Currently, this only works with the Silenced pistol and the Desert Eagle.

## Configuration

The `autoreload` and `autocbug` features can be configured directly through the `meta.xml` file or via the in-game admin panel.
