Settings can be configured directly through the `meta.xml` file or in-game admin panel.

| Setting                 | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autoreload`            | Automatically reloads the weapon after each shot by rapidly switching weapon slots (using the `quickreload` glitch). This also enables cbug for Shotgun and Sniper. |
| `autocbug`              | Automatically cancels the post-shooting animation when the player stops aiming with the Silenced pistol and the Desert Eagle.                                       |
| `crouchbug`             | Allows players to cancel the post-shooting animation by using the crouch key.                                                                                       |
| `fastfire`              | Allows players to cancel the full firing animation, enabling faster firing with slow-firing weapons such as the Desert Eagle.                                       |
| `fastmove`              | Allows players to move quickly with slow weapons (e.g. Deagle) by using specific key combinations while standing up after crouching.                                |
| `fastsprint`            | Allows players to tap space with a macro, boosting their speed beyond normal GTA San Andreas limits.                                                                |
| `highcloserangedamage`  | Allows players to remove the extremely high damage guns inflict when fired at very close range.                                                                     |
| `hitanim`               | Allows players to have 'hit by bullet' animations interrupt their aiming.                                                                                           |
| `quickreload`           | Allos players to reloads the weapon by switching weapon slots, bypassing the standard reload animation.                                                             |
| `quickstand`            | Allows players to quickly stand up by pressing the crouch, sprint, or jump controls immediately after releasing the aim button while crouched.                      |
